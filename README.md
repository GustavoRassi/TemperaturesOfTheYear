# TemperaturesOfTheYear
* This is a program I had to design for my programming exam, capable of calculating temperatures of each month of the year.
* The user inputs the highest and lowest temperature of each month.
* Then, the program will calculate and display:
  * The temperatures and the average of each month.
  * The average of the highest and lowest temperatures.
  * The coldest month of the year.
# What I learned
* Input data for every loop.
* Calculate and find the highest average.
* The use of an array as a structure.
* Access members of a structure with an array through each element.
